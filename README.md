# PokemonUniteData

This project aims to scrap pokemon unite data from the pokemon unite official website using scrapy tool.
Here the crawler crawls first to the initial website then gets hyperlink data of all the pokemons releases till date.
Then the crawler goes to the specific websites from the hyperlinks obtained and scrapes the information about pokemons like role, offense_stat etc.
Finally the information is stored in csv format.
